My Tutorials for working and practicing with opencv in C++
##### Set of Tutorials to understand and work with Opencv computer vision library using C++
when starting opencv can be quite intimidating for new users specially in C++ which itself is quite difficult because of all the confusing Syntaxes.

The aim here is to breakdown problems into subproblems and get a better understanding.

This readme will familiarize you with the key terms needed to understand image processing.

### KEY TERMS
- MAT is the basic container in which opencv stores an image, think of it as a matrix holding values of BGR arranged in rowXcolumn wise order.
- Any image is composed of two types of Channels namely Single Channel (Black & White) and Multi Channel (RGB) by default opencv stores image in BGR rather then   conventional RGB.
- Blending sounds like a fancy term but is indeed addition of two or more than two pictures together.  
- Brightness 
- Contrast, contrast can be simply put as the brightness of a pixel compared to its neighbours.

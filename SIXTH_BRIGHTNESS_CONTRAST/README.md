Two commonly used point processes are multiplication and addition with a constant:
`g(x)=αf(x)+β`
- The parameters α>0 and β are often called the gain and bias parameters
- sometimes these parameters are said to control contrast and brightness respectively.
You can think of f(x) as the source image pixels and g(x) as the output image pixels. Then, more conveniently we can write the expression as:
`g(i,j)=α⋅f(i,j)+β`
where i and j indicates that the pixel is located in the i-th row and j-th column.

in short this program will help us in doing this

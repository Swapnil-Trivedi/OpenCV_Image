##### Fairly simple tutorial to save the result of our modifications

- we will load an image 
- turn it to grayscale
- save the grayscale image
##### we will be using all major commands for opencv
- `imread` to load the image
- `cvtColor` to convert to grayscale
- `imshow` for showing the result
- `imwrite` to save our work
